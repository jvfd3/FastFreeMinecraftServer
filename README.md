# Fast and Free Minecraft Server

The concept of this project is to automate most of the server building and configurating so that with just a couple of clicks and some more minutes, a 24/7 Minecraft server is live and running.

## Planning

Methods that I have thought of:

- Shell script to do everything
- Python script to do everything
- Docker container
- Merge of human interaction and automation os some parts
- Etc.

## Researching

## History

What I want to do is to facilitate the process of creating a Minecraft server. I want to make it as easy as possible, so that anyone can do it.

Some ways that I created my own Minecraft server before:

1. Simple local server for LAN
2. Local Server + [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/)
3. Local Server + [Radmin](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
4. [Local Host](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) + [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/)/[Radmin](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
5. [Aternos](https://aternos.org/)
6. [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/)

When I first created a free Minecraft server, I had to wait for a long time at [Aternos](https://aternos.org/)' queue. They had anti-afk policies and other stuff that bothered me.
